 I will discuss one from programming language it's python
Python is a high-level, general-purpose and localized programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991 the Python design philosophy emphasizes the ability to read code with its notable use of important white spaces. Its language structures and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear logical code for small and large projects.
Then I'll discuss some uses for pyhton 
1-Machine learning and artificial intelligence
Machine learning and artificial intelligence is about city conversations as it gives the most promising jobs for the future. We make the computer learn based on previous experiences through stored data or better yet, we create algorithms that make the computer learn on its own
2-Game development
Python is also used in the development of interactive games. There are libraries like PySoy which is a 3D game engine that supports Python 3 and PyGame that provides functionality and a library for developing games.
3-Data science and data visualization
The data is money if you know how to extract relevant information that can help you assume calculated risks and increase profits. You study your data, perform operations and extract the required information
