The programming language is a vocabulary and a set of grammatical rules to guide a computer or computer to perform specific tasks. Programming languages ​​began to appear for the first time in 1940, when their goal was to communicate with computers, This was through an experiment by German Conrad Zeus, where he made the first programming language, This is called Blanccall, and it is designed for engineering use, However, it did not achieve the expected success, as the war was being waged at the time, which prevented its spread. In 1949 AD, the American "John McKillie" designed a small symbol, And he managed to achieve great success and spread very quickly, and he became one of the most important programming languages ​​around the world, This programming has gone through many developments over the years, and has turned into what is known today as Mark 1 Autocode. After that he went through many developments and adjustments to become as it is today. After that, many people started designing many icons and programming languages, like "Grace Hopper" from the United States, Where he devised a new programming language under the name FLOW-MATIC, Then he modified that programming by replacing mathematical symbols and putting words from the English language, Instead of these symbols, this program was introduced to the market in 1958. And now there are many programming languages, and one of the most famous ones is .. "Java, Prolog, Python, Basic, Pascal, Atlas Autocode, Dart Language, Ruby"
 Programming languages ​​are divided into:

1- high-level language (close to the language human beings understand) such as: C-Sharp, Python, and Java.
2-Low level language (close to machine language) such as: assembly language.
