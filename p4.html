The programming language is important because 
1-it specifies the relationship, meanings, and rules that allow programmers to communicate effectively with the machines they program.

2-You can guide your computer on what to do in human readable form

3-It allows the programmer to organize instructions in functions, procedures, etc.

4-This also allows the program to be divided into "parts" that can be developed by a group of developers

5-Provides portability - Low-level instructions for one computer will differ from those for another computer.
Now we will discuss some importance of python
1-Very flexible

As a dynamically written language, Python is really flexible. This means that there are no strict rules on how to build features, and you will have more flexibility in solving problems using different methods (although Python's philosophy encourages using the clear method to solve things).
2-Easy to understand

Being a high-level language, Python reads like the English language, which takes a lot of stress syntax learning from programming beginners. Python handles a lot of complications for you, so it is very friendly for beginners because it allows beginners to focus on learning programming concepts and you don't need to worry about too much detail
